# Welcome

I've recently graduated with an MSc in computer science after working in technology consulting for 6 years. I enjoy developing software in a variety of different contexts, esepcially solutions at the intersection of technology with art & history (my undergrad degree was in history!)

---

I have experience with a vareity of languages and tools, having a technology-agnostic approach to developing solutions - I love exploring a new langauge or framework that might help me build something new! Despite this, I have particular experience in Swift and iOS development (most recently I published [Art of Weather on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/art-of-weather/id1549375625)), as well as C/C++ and Java. I also write articles and how-tos on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fredcgray).

## A map to my portfolio of software engineering projects

## Personal Projects and Tools
I started my software development journey with iOS development in Objective-C as a teenager. I deployed my first app to the App Store in 2015 and have completed several more since then. I've kept my toes in the iOS waters over the years and I am experienced using Swift and SwiftUI. I have also built various tools in C++ for personal tools including for home automation on Arduino and a for managing archives.

| Name | Year | Description | Key Technologies  |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Seascape](https://github.com/fred1778/Seascape) | 2025-6 | A lightweight archive management tool for building and exploring 'seascape' archives | C++, SQLite, Shell |
| [Ting Ting](https://github.com/fred1778/Ting-Ting) | 2014-15 | My first app, a very simple letter game, published on the App Store in early 2015 | Objective-C, UIKit | 
| [Art of Weather (original)](https://github.com/fred1778/ArtOfWeather) | 2021 | A weather app that matches the weather conditions to Open Access art from the Metropolitan Musuem of Art's API, published early 2021. The repo is the original version - I rebuilt a new version from the ground-up in 2025 (see below) | Swift, SwiftUI | 
| [Art of Weather (2025 Reboot)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/art-of-weather/id1549375625) | 2025 |  I rebuilt 'Art of Weather' from the ground up to create a new version which used a Supabase backend to provide artworks, and enhanced information about artists via Wikidata. It is currently available on the App Store.  | Swift, SwiftUI, Supabase, Python (for image resizing utility) | 



## Academic Projects
Some of the larger projects I completed as part of my computer science MSc at the University of Bristol, including my final project (Easel), a cross-platform mobile app designed to provide an AI-free marketplace for artists. 


| Name | Year | Description | Key Technologies  |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Easel](https://github.com/fred1778/Easel) | 2025 | A prototype art marketplace designed to help protect artists from generative AI. Designed and built as part of my MSc Computer Science final project at the University of Bristol | Languages: Dart (client app), Python (serverless functions) Flutter, Firebase | 
| [Database Server](https://github.com/fred1778/JavaDB/tree/main) | 2025 | A server capable of parsing and executing queries from a subset of SQL on plain-text database tables | Java, SQL, Maven |
|[JavaStag](https://github.com/fred1778/JavaStag/tree/main) | 2025 | A text-based adventure game engine that ingests .dot and .xml files to create games | Java, Maven, XML |
| [AstroCat - a Rogue-like browser game](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-28) | 2025 | This game and repo was the deliverable of a software engineering group project, in which I was a developer and project management | JavaScript, p5js, Git |
