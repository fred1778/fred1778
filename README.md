# Welcome


I've recently graduated with an MSc in computer science after working in technology consulting for 6 years. I enjoy developing software in a variety of different contexts, esepcially solutions at the intersection of technology with art & history (my undergrad degree was in history!)

I have experience with a vareity of languages and tools, having a technology-agnostic approach to developing solutions - I love exploring a new langauge or framework that might help me build something new! Despite this, I have particular experience in Swift and iOS development (most recently I published [Art of Weather on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/art-of-weather/id1549375625)), as well as C/C++ and Java. I also write articles and how-tos on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fredcgray).
